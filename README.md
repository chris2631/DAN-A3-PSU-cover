This PSU/cable-cover is designed for SFX-PSU's mounted to the front with an additional offset towards the back panel (see foto, needs 1-2 extra holes to be drilled in the SSD/PSU mounting bracket).
If you plan on using a bottom mounted SSD, print the 'cover_ssd_NOfan_sfxPSUoffset.stl' file.
If you'd rather habe two bottom mounted intake-fans, print the 'cover_noSSD_butFAN_sfxPSUoffset.stl' file.

Make sure add additional supports to the cable-hiding part in your slicer (see foto) or print this part with slow speed. Otherwise you might get a bad looking 'wavy' finish due to vibrations.

I might add versions for ATX-PSUs and non-offset PSUs later.
If you do that feel free to add them.
